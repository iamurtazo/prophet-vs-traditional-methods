GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN COURSE - TERM PROJECT PROPOSAL
PROJECT TITLE:
"Can Prophet Forecasting Help Small Businesses Beat Amazon? A Case Study on 
Demand Forecasting Accuracy and Inventory Cost Savings"
1. PROBLEM STATEMENT AND RESEARCH QUESTION
Every online retailer faces the same basic problem: how much inventory to keep in the warehouse. If you order too much, you waste money on storage. If you order too little, customers get angry and go somewhere else. Big companies like Amazon solve this problem with fancy machine learning forecasting models that predict exactly what customers will buy. But these models cost money and need experts to run them. Small and medium-sized businesses usually just guess or use simple spreadsheet methods.
Our research question is simple and practical: Can a regular business use Prophet, which is the same type of forecasting tool that Amazon uses, to predict customer demand better than traditional methods? And more importantly, does this tool actually save money or is it just expensive technology that does not really help?
This matters because most supply chain classes teach that forecasting is important, but students do not actually know if it works in real business or if the benefits are worth the cost. We want to test this with actual data and show real numbers so other businesses can make smart decisions about whether to use Prophet for their own supply chains.
2. BACKGROUND ON PROPHET AND WHY IT MATTERS
Prophet is a forecasting tool created by Facebook that Amazon now uses through its AWS SageMaker service. It was designed to be simple enough for regular people to use without needing a PhD in statistics or machine learning. The tool looks at historical sales data and learns patterns like seasonality (when customers buy more, like holidays), trends (is sales going up or down), and random changes (unexpected spikes).
The reason Prophet matters for our research is that it sits between two worlds. Traditional forecasting methods like spreadsheet averages are cheap and easy but not very accurate. Advanced machine learning like Amazon's DeepAR is very accurate but requires expensive engineers and complicated infrastructure. Prophet is supposed to be the middle ground that small businesses can actually use and afford.
The key finding from existing research is that inventory costs are usually 25 to 35 percent of the value of inventory each year. So if a business has 1 million dollars in inventory and can reduce it by 10 percent through better forecasting, that is 25 to 35 thousand dollars saved per year. This is why getting forecasting right matters so much to businesses.
3. WHAT WE WILL STUDY AND WHAT WE WILL DELIVER
Our project focuses on one specific question: How well does Prophet actually forecast demand compared to simple methods, and how much money could a business save by using it?
We will test Prophet on real sales data from an online retailer. We will compare Prophet's forecasts against what a simple spreadsheet method would predict. Then we will calculate how much inventory cost a business could save by using the better forecast. Finally, we will estimate how much it costs to set up and run Prophet so a business can decide if it is worth it.
We will deliver three main outputs. First, a written report explaining how Prophet works, what we learned from testing it on real data, how much money it could save, and whether small businesses should use it. Second, we will create Python code that actually runs Prophet and shows the forecast versus reality. Third, we will give a presentation with charts and graphs showing the results in a way that business students and business people can understand.
We will not try to build our own forecasting model or explain all the advanced math behind Prophet. We are focusing on what a real business would care about: does it work, how much does it cost, and will it save money. We are also focusing only on e-commerce and online retail sales, not manufacturing or other supply chains.
4. HOW WE WILL DO THE RESEARCH
We will use a combination of three methods to answer our question. First, we will get real sales data from public datasets that show how many of a product customers bought each day or week over several years. Second, we will run Prophet on this data using Python and see what forecast it produces. Third, we will calculate how accurate the forecast was and how much money a business could save.
For the data, we will use publicly available demand datasets from online retailers. Amazon and other companies publish sample datasets specifically for testing forecasting tools. We will choose a dataset with at least two years of history so we can test if Prophet learns the patterns correctly.
For the analysis, we will use Python with libraries designed for forecasting and data analysis. We will split the data into two parts: use the first part to train Prophet so it learns the patterns, and use the second part to test if it predicts correctly. We will compare Prophet's accuracy against a simple spreadsheet formula that just takes the average of previous sales.
Then we will calculate the money impact. If Prophet reduces forecast error from 10 percent to 5 percent, that means a business can reduce safety stock. We will estimate how much inventory cost that saves based on typical warehouse costs. We will also estimate how much it costs to run Prophet: software costs and one person's time to manage it. This gives us the cost versus benefit.
We will also compare our Prophet results against what we know about Amazon's more advanced tools. We will not try to build Amazon's tools, but we will show how Prophet sits in the middle between simple spreadsheet forecasting and expensive advanced AI.
5. WHERE WE GET DATA AND HOW WE COLLECT IT
We will get our data from three main places. First, we will use open-source demand datasets that are publicly available for forecasting research. These datasets show real sales numbers from online retailers over time. Second, we will use AWS and Facebook documentation about Prophet to understand how it works and what results to expect. Third, we will use information from supply chain research to estimate costs and savings.
For the actual sales data, we will look for datasets with at least 500 days of history so Prophet has enough examples to learn from. Good datasets include those from Amazon's SageMaker examples, or from academic research papers that tested forecasting models. We want data that is realistic and includes seasonal patterns like higher sales around holidays.
For software and infrastructure information, we will check AWS pricing for SageMaker and Prophet. We will also look at Facebook's documentation on Prophet to understand requirements. Since Prophet is free and open-source, there is no software license cost, but running it on cloud servers does cost money.
For cost estimates, we will use information from supply chain textbooks and industry reports. These sources tell us typical warehouse costs, labor costs, and how inventory is usually managed. We will be careful to note that our estimates are based on typical businesses and might be different for a specific company.
We will collect this information over the first three weeks of the project and organize it in a spreadsheet. We will document where each number came from so anyone reading our report can understand our sources and assumptions.

7. CHALLENGES AND HOW WE WILL HANDLE THEM
The main challenge is that we do not have access to real Amazon data about their forecasting costs and results. Amazon keeps this information secret because it is a competitive advantage. We will solve this by using public information about AWS pricing and research papers that describe Prophet. We will be honest in our report about what is real data and what is reasonable estimates.
Another challenge is that forecasting accuracy depends heavily on the type of product and sales pattern. Products with steady, predictable sales are easier to forecast than products with crazy random spikes. We will handle this by choosing a dataset that has realistic seasonal patterns but is not too weird or random. We will also explain in our report that different products might have different results.
A third challenge is making sure our Python code works correctly. Forecasting requires careful data preparation and we need to make sure we do not make mistakes. We will solve this by testing on a small dataset first, checking results against what research papers found, and having multiple team members review the code.
Finally, time is limited. We only have eight weeks. We will focus only on Prophet and not try to test multiple forecasting tools. We will not try to build our own model. We will keep the analysis straightforward and focused on answering one main question rather than trying to cover everything.
8. WHAT WE WILL CREATE
We will create three main deliverables for this project. First, a comprehensive written report of approximately 10 pages that explains Prophet in detail, shows what we found from testing it on real data, and gives clear recommendations about whether businesses should use it. This report will include Python code examples, Excel spreadsheets with cost analysis, graphs comparing forecasts to actual sales, and discussion of test scenarios. The report will be formatted as a professional academic paper suitable for university submission. Second, we will create working Python code and supporting files that demonstrate Prophet actually running on real sales data. This will include the Python script, output files, graphs showing how Prophet's forecast compared to reality, accuracy measurements, and cost calculations in Excel. Third, we will create a 12-slide presentation with pictures, graphs, and numbers that we will present to the class and convert to PowerPoint format.
Our report will explain Prophet in simple terms so business students understand it without needing a machine learning degree. We will show real graphs of forecasts compared to actual sales. We will calculate how much money a business could save by using Prophet versus a simple method. We will compare the costs of using Prophet against these savings and show whether it makes financial sense. We will also explain what kinds of businesses Prophet works best for and what kinds should consider other options.
The presentation will have slides that build the story: here is the problem, here is what Prophet is, here is how it works, here is what we tested, here are the results, here is what it costs, here is whether it makes sense, and here is our recommendation. We will use graphs and numbers to make it visual and interesting so the audience does not have to read a lot of words.
9. WHY THIS PROJECT MATTERS
This project helps answer a real question that supply chain students need to understand. Textbooks say forecasting is important, but students do not really know if it works or if companies should actually spend money on it. By testing Prophet on real data and calculating real costs and savings, we show whether the theory actually works in practice.
Our research also shows that companies do not need to be as big as Amazon to benefit from good forecasting. Prophet is available and affordable for medium-sized businesses. Understanding this helps entrepreneurs and supply chain managers make better decisions about where to invest their money.
Finally, this project teaches us how to take a complex technical tool like Prophet and explain it so business people can understand it and make decisions. That is a crucial skill in real business life. We have to talk to our customers, our boss, and our investors in simple terms, not in technical jargon.
